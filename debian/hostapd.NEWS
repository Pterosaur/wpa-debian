wpa (2:2.6-8) unstable; urgency=medium

  Since 2:2.6-6, hostapd ships a systemd .service file. As hostapd comes
  with /etc/default/hostapd file, which by default doesn't specify any
  config file, to prevent installation or boot failures, the package's
  postinst script masks the hostapd.service unit on the first install.
  After editing the default file, users need to unmask it themselves.
